Motivations:

I want to be able to hypothesise, for example "when 'Asset X' is trading in a range (which must also be defined), it is more probable that any wick (upside or downside), in a given timeframe, will be filled within a set amount of time â€“ and therefore can use this idea to be profitable".

-> Then assess this hypothesis with a thorough backtest, and decide if true.

I want to be able to build this tool to a stage where these hypothesis can be created, then tested and evaluated.

I'm very much running with the assumption here that it will be very hard, if not impossible, to build a trading bot whereby you just deploy it and leave it and it will be profitable. I think it is much more reasonable to assume that we could find certain scenarios where deploying the bot will be profitable, but the market conditions must be monitored and trading should stop if pre-defined 'optimal' conditions are no longer present.
